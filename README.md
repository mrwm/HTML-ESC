# HTML-ESC
Make your text worse in HTML!

Check this page out at https://mrwm.github.io/HTML-ESC/

Places where this can be used:

1. Reddit (in markdown mode)
2. Any Discourse forums. Eg: [frame.work community](community.frame.work), [KDE Discussions](https://discuss.kde.org/)
3. I'm sure there are other sites that I haven't been to, but it's worth trying out :)
